## attemptFrequency controls how often DesirePaths will roll the dice to change blocks.
## attemptFrequency is in ticks. 20 ticks = 1 second. IT IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED TO SET THIS BELOW 5!!!
## Increase this number if you run into any performance issues but the effect of DesirePaths will be less apparent.
## THIS VALUE DOES NOT CHANGE WITH </desirepaths reload> YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER FOR THIS TO TAKE EFFECT!
attemptFrequency: 10

## movementCheckEnabled determines if we should run an extra check to see if the player is currently moving.
## Setting this to true means that unless a player is actively moving around we won't change the block below them.
## This setting will have an impact on the plugin's performance, if you have issues you should set this to false.
